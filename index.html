   <p><b>Pasta is mainly a dish which originated from Italy. Nowadays it can be made into many new and different styles.
    It is a dish which made from uneven dough of wheat flour and different spices, meat, and sauces. I frequently enjoy
    pasta quite often and the magic of it being the tastiest lies in it's time of boiling...</b> </p><br><br>

   <p><b>As a fellow Bengali we obviously love our traditional foods but apart from that we totally love our street foods more. What can I say such food stalls have our 
    hearts and one these stalls consist of Fuchka which we totally adore. The sweet and sour flavour and spices get along too well. It is a dish of a crisy shell filled with chickpeas, 
    spices, potatoe, onion, chat masala, and tarmarid chutney.It is also known by various other names...</b></p>

    <p>To make Fuchka at home from scratch be sure to check this video out.</p>

   <p><b>If we are talking about foods we can't miss out dessert. I feel like without dessert meals are incomplete. Therefore, as a chocolate lover I tend to enjoy brownies alot 
    more than I should. It is an American dish which might seem lika a normal chocolate cake but actually is much more dense and thick. There are many ways to enjoy it, such as with 
    ice cream, frosting, cream cheese and much more.</b></p><br>
